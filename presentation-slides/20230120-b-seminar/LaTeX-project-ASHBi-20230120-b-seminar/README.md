This beamer/presentation template aims to provide new users with an in-depth look at making use of the many features LateX has to offer while not straying far from the quintessential LaTeX beamer experience.

Much improvement is needed to match this format to the levels of those of IISER Thiruvananthapuram's current academic contemporaries. Those interested in assisting with the effort may contact [nikhil.alexv17@alumni.iisertvm.ac.in].
